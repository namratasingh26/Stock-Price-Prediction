# Stock Price Prediction  

This project implements a stock price prediction model using historical stock market data and machine learning techniques. The goal is to analyze past trends and predict future stock prices to assist investors in making informed decisions.  

## Features  
- Data collection from financial sources  
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering  
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Machine learning and deep learning models  
- Model evaluation and performance metrics  
- Visualization of stock trends and predictions  

## Technologies Used  
- Python  
- Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation  
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization  
- Scikit-learn for machine learning models  
- TensorFlow/Keras for deep learning models  
- LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) for time series forecasting
